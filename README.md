# Chrono Trigger (Steam) FMV Encoder / Decoder

A tool for the Steam version of Chrono Trigger that allows you to decode the FMV files (001-008.dat on the root) and encode your own mp4 files to replace them.

Thanks to [Aemony](http://steamcommunity.com/id/aemony) who posted on the Steam forums showing how easy the format was to decode.

## Instructions

- Grab the [latest release from here](https://github.com/davidluzgouveia/ct-fmv/releases)
- Drag a `.dat` on top of `ct-fmv.exe` to decode it into `.mp4`
- Drag a `.mp4` on top of `ct-fmv.exe` to encode it into `.dat`
